        <p>I was born in 2009. At the moment I have finished 8 grades and am in the 9th grade.
            During this time I have managed to do many things. And now I will tell you about them.</p>
            <p>Now my English level is about B1, but I am working hard to improve it. Now a little about sports, I played football for 10 years.
                 Also, recently I have become interested in studying programming.Here are the languages that I know.</p>

              Cpp
            </li>
            <li>
                Html
            </li>
            <li>Css</li>
            <li>C#</li>
             <li>JS</li>        
            
        </ul>
        <p>I know Cpp at a basic level. With the help of Html and CSS I can lay out a website. I am also currently studying C#,
             so far only halfway through my studies, also up to a basic level,
             and I am also studying JS, but so far only 3 lessons, so I am still a beginner.</p>
